Pizza dough (some type of mash up between NY style and Neapolitan style)

780g flour
530g water
teaspoon active dry yeast
23g salt

15g sugar (new addition)
25g olive oil (new addition)

mix in stand mixer on medium/low speed for 20-25 minutes.
Divide up and let rest/rise in room temp until they start to rise and the fermentation has started going and increased volume of the dough balls with roughly 50%.
Refrigerate and use whenever you want. Best is 2-3 days after making them.
Take out of fridge about an hour before making the pizzas, you don't want it to get the dough too warm so the yeast starts working again and accidentally overproof the dough.

Last time the pizzas came out pretty well. This iteration I'm adding sugar and oil to try and make them less chewy and brown more.
