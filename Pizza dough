Pizza dough (some type of mash up between NY style and Neapolitan style)

780g flour
530g water (68%)
teaspoon active dry yeast
23g salt

15g sugar (new addition)
25g olive oil (new addition)

mix in stand mixer on medium/low speed for 20-25 minutes.
Divide up and let rest/rise in room temp until they start to rise and the fermentation has started going and increased volume of the dough balls with roughly 50%.
Refrigerate and use whenever you want. Best is 2-3 days after making them.
Take out of fridge about an hour before making the pizzas, you don't want it to get the dough too warm so the yeast starts working again and accidentally overproof the dough.

Last time the pizzas came out pretty well. This iteration I'm adding sugar and oil to try and make them less chewy and brown more.

Results:
The dough came out very soft and hard to handle. It might have overproofed just a tiny bit.
Taste was nice, could've maybe used a tiny bit more salt.
Browning was great, it got a nice brown crust with a decent bottom without getting too tough and chewy.
I used almost a full teaspoon of active dry yeast. I'm uncertain but that might have been just a little bit much. The additional ingredients, mainly sugar, might have given the yeast enough boost that you don't need a full teaspoon. Perhaps go half a teaspoon or 3/4.

Suggestions for next time: Reduce water content to maybe 60% and try again with the rest the same. That would be 470g~ water.
