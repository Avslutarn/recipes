300-340g whole eggs
125g butter (salted)
275 + 440g whole milk
160g Grahams flour (Grahamsmj√∂l)
250g Manitoba cream flour
8g Salt

600-1000g cured pork belly.

- Combine eggs and first part of milk in a bowl.
- Stir in the flour until any lumps are gone and it's a smooth batter.
- Add the rest of the milk as well as the butter (melted) and salt. Stir enough to combine. Do not over mix.

- Butter or oil + breadcrumb an oven pan and put the pork (fairly thick pieces/dice) already fried into it.
- Pour the batter over it and bake at 200 degrees until it has a nice dark golden color to it.


Notes:
It can be a good idea to dice the pork into whatever shapes you prefer and bake it in the oven on the tray you're going to bake the pancake in.
When the pork is done, take it out and put it aside while you drain the fat in the pan. This can be left in if you want extra porky flavor and a lot of extra calories.
With the residual pork fat, add breadcrumbs and shake to cover.
You can save time by frying the pork in the oven while you prepare the batter.

Traditionally served with lingonberry jam, but true heroes use strawberry jam.
