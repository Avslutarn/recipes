Experiment of a no knead dough:

## 2023-04-04 Test Nr 01 ##

Bakers percentage:
100% Flour
80% Water
3% Salt
1.5% Instant yeast

Amounts: 450g flour

Combined, let sit out for about 2-3h, punched down and put in the fridge.
Next day I punched down again and did a quick folding of it before returning to fridge.
In the evening I punched down and folded.

Morning after 2 days in the fridge I took it out, poured it out on a worksurface with a bit of flour and shaped the loaf. Put it on a baking sheet paper under a bowl and let sit while pre-heating the oven and dutch oven.

250 degrees C
Baked with a lid for 25 min. It had gotten some color.
Baked without a lid for about 15-18 minutes. It had a nice deep color.

It came out with the crust feeling quite hard and nice, but the bread turned out quite soft when it cooled.
Flavour was good, salt level could be increased to 3.5%. Thinking it might have been over proofed as it lacked a stiff structure. Yeast could probably be lowered to .5%. Wet doughs are really friendly to yeast.

450g flour was good. It is a nice sized loaf. Perhaps the size requires different cooking times and temperatures. Probably will do 450g next time as well.

I think for next time, I will try 3.5% salt and 0.5% instant yeast. I will monitor how quickly it rises and depending on what I see I will let it sit out for shorter or longer before going in the fridge.
