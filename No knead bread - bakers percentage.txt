Experiment of a no knead dough:

## 2023-04-04 Test Nr 01

Bakers percentage:
100% Flour
80% Water
3% Salt
1.5% Instant yeast

Amounts: 450g flour

Combined, let sit out for about 2-3h, punched down and put in the fridge.
Next day I punched down again and did a quick folding of it before returning to fridge.

More updates to come.
