My aged eggnog recipe, same process as Adam's but different ratios.
I usually halve the amount of sugar

250ml    cream
250ml    milk
50g      sugar
2        eggs
250ml    Bourbon
250ml    Rum or more bourbon
Nutmeg   for garnish or directly into the jar for more infused flavor






Adam Ragusea's Aged Eggnog recipe

**EGGNOG RECIPE, MAKES ABOUT A QUART/LITER**

1 cup (237mL) cream
1 cup (237mL) additional cream or milk
1/2 cup (100g) sugar
2 eggs
1 cup (237mL) rum
1/2 cup (118mL) whiskey
nutmeg for garnish

Whip the first cup of cream in a small bowl. 
In a big bowl, beat the eggs and slowly drizzle 
in the alcohol until incorporated — don't stop mixing, 
or the eggs will curdle. It's important to mix the 
alcohol directly into the eggs to kill bacteria. 
Mix in the sugar, un-whipped cream or milk and the 
whipped cream until smooth. 

Transfer the eggnog to a vessel that will allow 
gas to escape and chill in the refrigerator for 
about three weeks — aging will kill bacteria and 
enhance the flavor.  The mixture will separate a 
bit as it sits, so stir it back up before pouring 
into glasses. Sprinkle nutmeg over top, if you're into that.
