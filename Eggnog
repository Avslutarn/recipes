My aged eggnog recipe, same process as Adam's but different ratios.
I usually halve the amount of sugar

250ml    cream
250ml    milk
50g      sugar
2        eggs
250ml    Bourbon
250ml    Rum or more bourbon
Nutmeg   for garnish or directly into the jar for more infused flavor

Review of batch 2024-12-03:
First day it tasted not at all sweet. Very prominent and sharp alcohol flavour. 
Previous years the sharp alcohol flavor dissipates around week 2/3. I don't 
have any memory of what I thought about the sweetness right off the bat. Might 
increase sugar content for next batch. Adam's recipe has already reduced the sugar content iirc, so halving that might be too much.




Adam Ragusea's Aged Eggnog recipe

**EGGNOG RECIPE, MAKES ABOUT A QUART/LITER**

1 cup (237mL) cream
1 cup (237mL) additional cream or milk
1/2 cup (100g) sugar
2 eggs
1 cup (237mL) rum
1/2 cup (118mL) whiskey
nutmeg for garnish

Whip the first cup of cream in a small bowl. 
In a big bowl, beat the eggs and slowly drizzle 
in the alcohol until incorporated — don't stop mixing, 
or the eggs will curdle. It's important to mix the 
alcohol directly into the eggs to kill bacteria. 
Mix in the sugar, un-whipped cream or milk and the 
whipped cream until smooth. 

Transfer the eggnog to a vessel that will allow 
gas to escape and chill in the refrigerator for 
about three weeks — aging will kill bacteria and 
enhance the flavor.  The mixture will separate a 
bit as it sits, so stir it back up before pouring 
into glasses. Sprinkle nutmeg over top, if you're into that.
